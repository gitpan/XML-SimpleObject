DESCRIPTION

This is a small and simple package that takes the output of XML::Parser as 
a tree, and gives simple methods for accessing the structure of an XML 
document. It is very lightweight, but provides the simplest access to an XML document possible. It does not subclass XML::Parser; rather, it is meant to serve purely as an object struct for an outgoing tree.

REQUIREMENTS

None, but it's useless without XML::Parser. Only tested with perl5.6.0 on Linux and FreeBSD.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make 
  make install

Then look at ex.pl. That pretty much sums up the functionality.
